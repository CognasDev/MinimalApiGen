# MinimalApiGen - TO DO

1. Improve pagination so that it returns errors - see switch statement from old code
2. ArgumentNullReference checks for injected services and keyed services
3. See if support can be added for query parameters in the GET URL
4. Add support for multiple lines in query ctor.
5. Cacheable testing - https://andrewlock.net/creating-a-source-generator-part-10-testing-your-incremental-generator-pipeline-outputs-are-cacheable/ - BIG JOB!!
6. Snapshot testing - https://andrewlock.net/creating-a-source-generator-part-2-testing-an-incremental-generator-with-snapshot-testing/
